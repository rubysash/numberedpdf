# PDF Page Numbering Tool

A Python script that adds page numbers to PDF files. The script can process single PDFs, multiple PDFs individually, or combine multiple PDFs into a single numbered document.

## Features

- Add page numbers to a single PDF file
- Process multiple PDF files in a directory individually
- Combine multiple PDFs and add page numbers to the combined document
- Page numbers are displayed in a hot pink background rectangle for readability
- Numbers are centered within the rectangle
- Output files preserve original files by creating new ones with '-n' suffix

## Installation

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python packages. Here's how to set it up:

1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

The main requirement is PyMuPDF, but using the requirements.txt file will ensure all dependencies are properly installed.

## Usage

The script can be run in several ways depending on your needs:

```bash
python add_page_numbers.py [-s] [-a] [-h] [<input_pdf_path>]
```

### Arguments

- `-s` Stitch all matching PDF files together, then add page numbers and export as a single file
- `-a` Process all PDF files in the current directory individually (adds page numbers to each)
- `-h` Display the help message
- `<input_pdf_path>` (Optional) Path to the input PDF file. If provided, only this file will be processed

### Examples

1. Add page numbers to a single PDF file:
   ```bash
   python add_page_numbers.py document.pdf
   ```
   Creates: `document-n.pdf`

2. Add page numbers to all PDF files in current directory:
   ```bash
   python add_page_numbers.py -a
   ```
   Creates: `doc1-n.pdf`, `doc2-n.pdf`, etc.

3. Combine all PDFs and add page numbers:
   ```bash
   python add_page_numbers.py -s
   ```
   Creates: `stitched_20250111123456-n.pdf`

4. Display help message:
   ```bash
   python add_page_numbers.py -h
   ```

## Output File Naming

- For individual files: The output file will be named the same as the input file with '-n' appended before the file extension
  - Example: `document.pdf` â†’ `document-n.pdf`
- For stitched files: The output file will be named with a timestamp
  - Example: `stitched_20250111123456-n.pdf`

## Page Number Format

- Location: Bottom right corner of each page
- Background: Hot pink rectangle for visibility
- Text: Black numbers, centered in the rectangle
- Font: Helvetica, 12pt

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for:
- File not found
- Invalid file paths
- Missing input arguments

## Notes

- Original PDF files are never modified
- Files ending in '-n.pdf' are skipped when using the -a option to prevent processing already numbered files
- When using -s (stitch) option, temporary files are automatically cleaned up
